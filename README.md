## About Me

I’m currently working as an Account Manager at Decowraps. Alongside this role, I’m working on a project to bring Decowraps’ Hardware Showroom to clients worldwide, making digital solutions accessible on a global scale.

At the same time, I’m focused on growing as a Frontend Developer. I’m passionate about creating websites that are not only visually engaging but also accessible, performant, and user-friendly.
