# 🙋‍♀️ Hi, i'm Lisa!

💻  Graduated from Frontend Development & Design @ AUAS 


## About Me

I’m currently working as an Account Manager at Decowraps. Alongside this role, I’m leading a project to bring Decowraps’ Hardware Showroom to clients worldwide, making digital solutions accessible on a global scale.

At the same time, I’m focused on growing as a Frontend Developer. I’m passionate about creating websites that are not only visually engaging but also accessible, performant, and user-friendly. I believe good design goes hand in hand with solid code, and I enjoy bringing both worlds together to deliver meaningful digital experiences.

With a good eye for detail and design, I love experimenting with new technologies and frameworks, while staying committed to best practices in usability, accessibility, and performance. My goal is to grow into a frontend role where I can combine creativity, technical expertise, and user-centered thinking to make an impact. ✨
