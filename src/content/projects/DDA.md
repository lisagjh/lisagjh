During my last year at FDND I worked on this project with two classmates. This project was done in collaboration with <a href="https://www.voorhoede.nl/nl/">de Voorhoede</a>, who made the real new website for <a href="https://dutchdigitalagencies.com/">Dutch Digital Agencies</a>. We got to work together with their team lead, Declan, who is great at what he does. Each sprint review he gave us a lot of valuable feedback, from which I learned a lot.

Declan let us make some creative choices of our own, to improve the design. I definitely took advantage of it. You can compare our version with the official one, and see the changes. The main ones are the menu and the banner carousel on the homepage.

For the banner carousel the biggest challenge was finding a way to make all logo's look good. Personally, I still prefer my version to the real one's, since some logo's are barely visible there.

The menu I made into a sidebar instead of in the header, because in the design they <em>"cheated"</em> by making the font-size like 12px. I'm not a fan of small font-sizes, and would rather find another solution.

When I added the sidebar, I also added the `view-transition` on the active state to make it more pleasurable. I also implemented scroll-driven-animations on the homepage.

This project was made with SvelteKit. We started working on it shortly after Svelte 5 was released.
