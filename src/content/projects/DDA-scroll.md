At FDND we had a special sprint where we got to let our creativity run free and build fun stuff, and let go of the styleguide of our client. Each week we got a new random prompt, focused on a certain new-ish technology.

This week we focused on scroll driven animations. My prompt was <em>Sad Acid Graphics Scroll Driven Animations</em>.

I had already done CSS scroll driven animations plenty of times, so I decided to do something different. But before I started building, I did some research. I started out analysing my prompt, and what the words meant. I looked up images fitting this vibe. I saw a lot of wireframe shapes, grids, and black and white colors.

Then I started figuring out the overall design with some rough sketches. I did not have the patience to work the whole thing out in detail, so I got right to building it!

I really wanted to use Three.js to create wireframe donut. I had already started to learn some basic Three.js during the summer, so I could reuse most of that code. 
Once I got the shape right, I started the animation. I got a first version working pretty fast, but it was a bit too fast and not-smooth for my taste, so I added some easing.

And after many small tweaks and way too many hours looking for a fitting font, I was done! I still really like this project. It was a lot of fun, got me out of the school slum and showed me that coding is fun and the opportunities are ENDLESS.
