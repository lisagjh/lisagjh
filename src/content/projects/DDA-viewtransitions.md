At FDND we had a special sprint where we got to let our creativity run free and build fun stuff, and let go of the styleguide of our client. Each week we got a new random prompt, focused on a certain new-ish technology.

This week my prompt was <em>Glitzy Brutalist View Transitions</em>, which I absolutely loved.

I started out analysing my prompt again, figuring out what the words meant. I decided to focus more on the brutalist than on the glitzy part.
